# About

Marmoset is an implementation of the [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) programming language.

I started my journey of learning how to write interpreters and compilers in college by reading Thorsten Ball's ****Writing an Interpreter in Go***.
However, I did many things by myself, only really using the book as a reference if I got stuck and couldn't figure something out.

It now gives me a good excuse to properly read through and write an implementation as Thorsten' book describes.
